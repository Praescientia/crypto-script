Model, View, Controller

1. Data Managing Model
    - Maybe just deal with csv files initially?
    - End goal should be to get an SQL server running
2. Data Parsing Model (Trading Model)
2. Trading Controller
    - Exchange (or local) specific order submission model
    - Make portfolios, etc
3. Backtesting Model

Models interact with data. Models can call other models. Models can be called by Controllers. Models cannot be called by Views.
Controllers interact with Models. Controllers cannot interact with data directly. Controllers can be called by Controllers.
Views interact with Controllers. Views cannot interact with Models.

For every module, only the main_funcs can be called from other modules. Helper methods cannot be called from other modules.

Models do not print anything, except logging.
Controllers can print messages.

Design Mistake: Bfutures database should be named BfuturesPrice. mb lol.
